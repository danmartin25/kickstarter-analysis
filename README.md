# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.


# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise's play Fever is in the early stages of production. She had a fundraising goal, but the pledged money fell just short of that goal. What does this mean for her?

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to support Louise for her play, Fever. To support her we combed through data of past theatrical productions and looked at any trends we could find, and what those trends meant for Fever.

## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis consisted of two main parts. Louise has data on Fever for fundraising goal and pledged amount. She also may know or may be looking to change what month the play will begin. So first, we looked at the outcomes based on launch date. Second, we looked at outcomes based on goals. In the context of the project, outcomes refers to if the play succeeded, failed, or was canceled.
